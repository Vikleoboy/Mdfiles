# My Journey in Tech 🚀

Hello everyone! I’m Vikleo, and today I want to share a bit about my personal journey in technology, some lessons learned, and a few moments that inspired me along the way.

## Early Days

My fascination with computers started at a young age. I remember the first time I wrote a simple program in Rust—it was both confusing and exhilarating. The feeling of making something work, even if it was just printing "Hello, World!", was magical.

## Learning and Growth

As I dove deeper, I realized that learning to code is not just about syntax, but about problem-solving. I spent countless nights debugging, reading documentation, and asking questions on forums. The open-source community became my second home.

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    println!("{}", s);
}
